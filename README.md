Welcome to the Reference Impl!

The Reference Impl is a convenience project for working with all of the HSPC Sandbox projects.  All HSPC Sandbox projects are referenced as modules within the Reference Impl, and a convenience script exist for installing the Reference Auth MySQL database and for creating all reference applications client configurations.  To use the Reference Impl effectively, clone out all HSPC Sandbox projects including the Reference Impl to a single folder and import the Reference Impl into your favorite IDE.  Choose a Maven Profile that suites your development needs.

### How do I get set up? ###
Clone the Reference Impl project and all other HSPC Sandbox projects to a single folder.

For example, I have a folder, hspconsortium, that looks like this:

    hspconsortium$ ls
    appointment-viewer
    bilirubin
    bilirubin-app
    bilirubin-data
    examples
    java-client
    patient-data-manager
    reference-api
    reference-apps
    reference-auth
    reference-impl
    reference-messaging
    reference-release
    reference-release-spring-boot
    sandbox-manager
    tools
